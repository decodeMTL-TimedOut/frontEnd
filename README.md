# TimedOut

TimedOut is a service application built with React that brings gamers with similar interests together.  Just search for any game and start grouping up right away.

Users will search for a game of their preference and then join a party that is available.  If none are available, they may make their own party customized to their preferences.

The UI was built with Javascript in React.  CSS was used to make it responsive across multiple platforms.

Our TimedOut API and database was built with Node, Express, and MySQL

FrontEnd technologies: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
BackEnd technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL
